        ## Classes:
                - Detect_Image: The class for analyzing the image given by the user.


        ## Functions:
                - 'detect_image()': For Analyzing the image
                

        ## Variables.
                - 'content' : the image matrix
                - 'image' : The type of the image which will portray the content
                - 'text_response' : The text contained in the image with other features like location of the text
                - 'predictions' : prediction for the image type
                - 'face_response' : Respone of the face(features of the face) after detecting face
                - 'face_content': Face Annotations
                - 'conf': The confidence of the prediction of the emotions
                - 'face_content_result': The likelihoof of all the emotions

## How we build it:
We used the Google Clould Vision API,  Flask ,Python,  HTML to host it on the web page page.

## Running the Codes

Run command `python main.py` on Anaconda Prompt

The folder named "images" will contain the images which you will upload/import.

Idea/Mission:
Built a Auto Vision Scanner using the powerful Google Cloud Vision API that scans the image, analyses and converts the image into text. It locates any textual content in the image and extracts it. 
You’ll be amazed by the extent to which the powerful Google Cloud Vision API visualises and extracts the text from the image. 

Project Inspiration
The main inspiration behind the project is the inconvenience we face on a day to day basis when there’s a need to store a doctor's prescription, medical bills, grocery bills, important notes, diary content and basically any important document that one has a possibility of losing when written on a paper. 
This project can easily solve this issue by digitally storing the important documents.

On a broad level, this application can be used for investigation purposes for tracking and analysing. Infact, the application has the capability to give similar image suggestions as well.

Key Learnings
The application made us explore the Google Cloud Vision API for the first time, implement Flask while integrating it with HTML and Javascript.
